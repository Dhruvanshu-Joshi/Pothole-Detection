# Overview

One of the key problems in computer vision is recovering the three dimensional structure of a scene from its images

In order to go from images to full metric reconstruction we need the following information:

1. position and orientation of camera with respect to the world coordinate frames.These are refered to as external parameters of the camera.

2. internal parameters of the camera such as its focal length.

Determining external and internal parameters is known as camera caliberation.
