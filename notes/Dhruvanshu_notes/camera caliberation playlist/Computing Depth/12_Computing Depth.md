# Computing Depth

the world coordinates are converted into the respective image coordinates.

We know the camera caliberation as

![cd2](cd2.png)

Hence:
![cd3](cd3.png)

![cd4](cd4.png)

![cd5](cd5.png)

![cd6](cd6.png)

  **Hence through this caliberation system we go from arbitrary views to depth map of scene**

We can use this for 3D reconstruction!
