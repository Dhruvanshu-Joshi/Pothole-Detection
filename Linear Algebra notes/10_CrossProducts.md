# 10_CrossProducts

Cross products of vector v and vector w in 3d is the area enclosed by a parrallelogram within the 2 vectors Taking orientation into consideration.

If v is on right of w , v cross w is +ve.

If v is on left of w , v cross w is -ve.

Therefore **Order matters**

By representing linear transformation like this, we move the basis vectors i hat and j hat to vector v and vector w and calculate determinant.

If v is on left of w , orientation was flipped while carrying out linear transformation hence negative determinant.

When two products are perpendicular , the area enclosed is maximum and hence the cross product is maximum.

**3v cross w = 3(v cross w)**

True cross product is something which combines two 3d vectors to form a new 3d vector which has length equal to the area enclosed by these two vectors and orientation can be calculated by the right hand rule.

The vector thus obtained is the cross product of the two vectors perpendicular to both of them.
